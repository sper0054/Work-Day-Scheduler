# Work-Day-Scheduler
A daily task planner that will save your inputs (tasks and to-do list) for the timeblocks and color code the hour-blocks based on your local time.

## Description
When you load the page, the current date and time is displayed at the top. When you click into a timeblock you can type an task and hit the save button. When you refresh the page, the task will still appear. As time ticks away, the past hours will turn grey, the current hour will be red, and future hours will be green.
